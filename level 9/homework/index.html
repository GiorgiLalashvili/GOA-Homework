    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p><strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy <strong><em>emphasizes</em><br> code readability with the use of significant indentation.</strong> <strong>Python</strong> was invented in the late <strong> 1980s</strong> <br> <strong><em>by Guido van Rossum</em></strong> at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> as a successor <br> to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling <br>and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.</p>

    <h2>C</h2>
    <p><b>C</b> (pronounced like the letter <strong>c</strong>) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the <strong>1970</strong>s by <br> <strong><em>Dennis Ritchie</em> </strong>and remains <em><strong>very widely used</strong></em> and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the <br> capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol <br>stacks, <strong>but its use in application software has been decreasing.</strong></p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><strong><em>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</em></strong> <em>first proposed</em> the <u>concept</u> of CSS in <strong>1994</strong> as a way to solve the problems of document <br>presentation on the web being controlled solely by HTML.<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (CSS) is a <em>style sheet language</em> <br>used for specifying the presentation and <strong>styling</strong> of a <br> document written in a markup language such as <strong>HTML</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> (including XML dialects such as SVG, <br> MathML or XHTML). <strong>CSS</strong> is a <u>cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web</u>, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>C#</h2>
    <p>The <strong>C#</strong> programming language was designed by <strong><em>Anders Hejlsberg</em></strong> from <u>Microsoft</u> in <strong>2000</strong> and was later approved <br> as an international standard by Ecma in <strong>2002</strong> and ISO/IEC in <strong>2003</strong>. <br> <u>Microsoft</u> introduced <strong> C#</strong> along with <u>.NET</u> Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the <br> time, <u> Microsoft</u> had no open-source products. <strong>4 years</strong> later, in <strong>2004</strong>, a free and open-source project called Mono <br>began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the <strong>C#</strong> <em>programming language</em>.</p>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p><strong>Java</strong> is a <em>high-level</em>, <em>class-based</em>, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation <br>dependencies as possible. <strong>Java</strong> gained popularity <u>shortly after its release</u>, and has been a very popular programming <br>language since then. <strong>Java</strong> was originally developed by <strong><em>James Gosling</em></strong> at <strong><em>Sun Microsystems.</em></strong> It was released in <strong>May</strong> <u> 1995</u> <br>as a core component of Sun's Java platform.</p>
